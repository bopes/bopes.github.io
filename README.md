# Bopes DB Cheatsheets

### Purpose:

This site is intended to articulate database querying languages and ORMs in plain English to beginning programmers.  The descriptions of each method are in "normal" English to be easily readable without much coding experience. The syntax examples are color-coded to identify static and dynamic syntax, and the variable names describe the data type they represent.

I hope this presentation removes even the smallest bit of abstraction from the definitions, which can lead to frustration to early programmers.
