### What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned how to manipulated positioning using the padding/borders/margin attributes. I also used *{ borders:1px dashed blue;} to view each element when I was trying to arrange them.

### What did you learn about CSS positioning?

It's a nightmare, especially at the beginning. I'm still understanding how the display & position attributes interact to place elements on the page in relation to each other.  Changing one of those attributes for a single element can totally change the page, so I'm just trying to get comfortable with them.

### What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easiest aspects were definitely the text format modifications. Those were a piece of cake. The hardest were the positioning. I bit off more than I could chew when I designed my header, which included an image, my name, a navbar and links to various social media sites. Organizing those together was very tricky. I was probably too reliant on div's there, and should have better used ID's and classes.

### What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

It can be very frustrating, but it's also easy to get sucked into it and perfecting your page.  I do like how easy it is to use the same stylesheets for multiple pages, especially if there are shared components.
