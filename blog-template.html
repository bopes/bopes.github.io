1. How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

I liked the way we could bounce ideas off each other during the wireframing portion. We definitely each came up with some ideas the other wouldn't have thought of. thCreating the HTML was a little challenging since I wanted to take the reigns myself and start coding, but I wanted to work as a good pair and hopefully refrained myself.

2. Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Wireframing was very helpful, since we could see what teh other was talkign abotu very definitively.

3. What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

A good wireframe was thorough and included all the components on the page. It did not have to be super clean, as long as the different components were included.  It also helped to define the audience/intent before starting and getting too detailed.

4. What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

We experimented with <header>, <footer>, and <aside>.  We also tried out nested lists for the first time, which provided exactly what we wanted in our sidebar.
