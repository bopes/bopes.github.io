          What are the benefits of version control?<br><br>
          Version control is a way to track your progress while you are editing files.  If you are editing multiple files, version control will track changes across all your files at once and in one place. You will keep a running history of your changes over time, and will be able to jump backward to view your project at any point in history. Also, if you have a team collaborating on a single project, version control lets each team member work on the same files simultaneously. When they finish and send their updates to the rest of the team, everyone else will be able to view their progress and understand their work.  <br><br>
          How does git help you keep track of changes?<br><br>
          Git is one particular type of version control software. It structures your project into a master version, with other versions branching off.  When you embark on a new venture in your project, such as adding a new feature, you can create a new branch in which to do the work. All your progress will be contained within that branch without affecting the master version fo your project.  When your module has been finished, you can merge it back into the master and your new features will be included.  This lets you work on several features at once without having to keep track of them together.  If you have an entire team working together, everyone can work on their own features independently and merge them together to make the final version.<br><br>
          Why use GitHub to store your code?<br><br>
          GitHub is an online file repository that lets you store your code publicly, rather then on your local machine. This lets teams work from a single source across multiple computers and locations. GitHub also is fully integrated with git, so it can easily handle commits from multiple users at once and encourages team reviews by requiring someone to review each commit before merging it into the master version.  GitHub also lets you publish your code generally and solicit feedback and advise from the greater GitHub community.
