        <h2>Looping</h2>
        <h3>Mar 7 2016</h3>
        <!-- <img src="imgs/#" alt="Blog Post Image"> -->
        <p>
          When you're dealing with arrays or hashes in Ruby, you frequently need to apply some code to every element in the container. Ruby makes it easy, because the enumerable methods like #each, #map, and #collect know how to go through each element and do something. But say you aren't using Ruby -- you're using JavaScript, which doesn't have any enumerable methods. So how do you affect every item in an array? <br><br>
          Fortunately, it's still possible. It just requires you to use a loop, which does a bit of code over and over again, that's tracked by manual counting (For the record, you can use a manual counter in Ruby as well. You just don't have to). <br><br>
          The main looping mechanism in JavaScript is the FOR loop. To execute a FOR loop, you need to set up the 'looper,' and then put your code inside of it. <br><br>
          The 'looper', as I call it, specifies these three things: <br>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The Counter <br><br>
              This is the variable that keeps track of how many times you've looped, and its starting value. <br><br>
              Example: <code>var counter = 0</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              The Loop Criteria <br><br>
              This is the criteria that determines how many times you loop. As long as this criteria evaluates to "true", the looper will run again. Frequently, this sets the upper bound on the counter. <br><br>
              Example: <code>counter < 5</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              The Counter Increase <br><br>
              This is actually optional, but I always like to include it. It determines what changes with each successive loop. <br><br>
              Example: <code>counter = counter + 1</code> <br><br>
              (Sidenote - this particular instance can be shortened to counter += 1, to increase by 1 with each loop. It can be shortened even further to counter++, if brevity is really your thing!)
            </li>
          </ol>
          When you put it all together, it looks like this: <br><br>
          <code>for ( var counter = 0 ; counter < 5 ; counter ++ ) {....code block....} ;</code><br><br>
          This loop will do whatever appears in the code block exactly five times. <br><br>
          If you want to execute some code against every element in an array, you can do the following: <br><br>
          <code>for ( var counter = 0 ; counter < array.length ; counter ++ ) { array[counter] ...... } ;</code> <br><br>
          This is a great way to loop through an entire array, even if you don't know how long the array is going to be! <br><br>
          The way to do this same loop in Ruby would be the following:<br><br>
          <code>array.each do</code><br>
          <code>some code</code><br>
          <code>end</code><br><br>
          As you can see, Ruby' #each method makes it a lot easier to read and write these types of loops. But that just shows how readable Ruby can be -- JavaScript can still execute the exact same functions, it just takes a little manual manipulating to get it working!
