    Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

From your GitHub page, you have the option to create a new repository within the site's UI. Then you seelect several attributes, like the repository name, public/private status, README, and license.  With all that selected selected, the repository is successfully saved on GitHub. On the repository page, you can find the HTTPS URL for the repository - copy this to your clipboard.  To clone the repository to your computer, open terminal and navigate to the folder you want to put the repository in.  Then run this code in your terminal: $ git clone [HTTPS URL]. The repository will be copied to your computer into the intended folder.

    Describe what open source means.

Open source means a site's code can be publicly downloaded, edited, and distributed.

    What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I'm excited about open source. It's a great way to gather ideas from the development community at large, and lets you see what other people have done to give you ideas and further your understanding.

    Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses are necesasry because it cuts down on your administrative busywork.  Your ideas are protectd and attributed to you, but it still allows others to access without requiring your constant feedback and moderation.  It opens you up to the benefits of the Open Source world without the exposign you to liability and theft.

    What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

This challenge revisited the core steps of creating a repository, commiting changes and pushing to GitHub, and then capturing the changes in a pull request.  This was the first opporunity to make an index.html page and see the code actually appear on the internet. I didn't have any real 'aha' moments or find anything particularly difficult - most of the lessons I understood pretty well from previous challenges or experiences before DBC. One question about pull requests, though -- the list of commits shows two commits for each change: (1) the commit I make myself, and (2) the pull request merging into the GitHub master.  This seems to duplicate the number of commits shown on the repository page. Why is this? Also, I'll need to spend some more time analyzing the differences between the various license types, since there are so many.

    Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I didn't find any outside sources yet, I'll dive into the differences between the licenses once I have something to share :)
